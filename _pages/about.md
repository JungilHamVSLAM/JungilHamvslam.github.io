Jungil Ham is pursuing a Ph.D. in Mechanical and Robotics Engineering at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST). His research focuses on visual localization, mapping, and orientation estimation for robots operating in complex environments, including space robotics, indoor aerial platforms, and structurally constrained scenes.

He is the first author of the San Francisco World visual compass work, which addresses drift-free orientation estimation by leveraging structural priors and digital twins, and has demonstrated related systems through indoor drone experiments and real-world robotic deployments.

Jungil has conducted research through internships at Sungkyunkwan University and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), where he broadened his perspective on robotics systems, perception, and applied research. He also collaborated closely with the NASA Ames Research Center Intelligent Robotics Group as a research intern. He received his M.S. in Mechanical and Robotics Engineering from GIST and his B.S. in Electronics and Information Engineering from Kwangwoon University.
